* For Market segmentation -> use jobs instead of product categories (product category definition: https://simplicable.com/new/product-category)

## JTBD Steps (from "The Innovation Toolkit" book)

### Identify a Focus Market

* Available growth strategies
    * Core growth
    * Related job growth
    * New job growth
    * Disruptive growth

IMO, I think the idea is around _Related job growth_, because I want to tackle more than one JTBD. For example _I want to learn how to read music while also singing_, which might sounded related at first but each one of them implies a lot of stuff

### Identify Jobs Customers Are Trying to Get Done
What are my customers trying to achieve?
* sing
* read music
* teach in a choir
* organize their songs
* practice the choir songs
* train their singing (like: "Ok, now I want to vocalize/do a warm-up before I start signing)

### Categorize the Jobs to be Done
Listing the jobs based on signers and teachers!
All of these jobs will be later prioritized.

#### Jobs and sub-jobs for singers
* listen the choir songs
    * access them without too much trouble
    * have a way of listen to them really easy and without problem
* get better at singing
    * practice them so I can get better at signing
        * play/pause/stop at any moment
        * repeat certain parts of the songs
        * have a way to measure if I'm hitting the right note or not (related to the 'getting better at signing' expectation)
* organize choir songs in a way that makes sense to me
    * make playlists based on my needs (singing 'registry', todo-4-next-session, favorites, etc.)

#### Jobs and sub-jobs for teachers
* give the singers the songs I want in a easy way so they can practice
    * need to upload the songs without any problem
    * 'songs' for me is music per chord, music sheet and actual song.
* manage the choir's content
    * add/update/remove songs per chord
    * upload music sheets
    * upload vocal exercises per chord
    * notify people when there are changes like a new song uploaded or 'remember to practice for X date' (nice to have)
* organize my choirs so I can keep track of what I'm doing with them
    * add choir
    * delete choir
    * edit choir's info (name, dates in which we have sessions/presentations, etc.)
* manage my songs in a way that I could easily pick the most appropriate for a certain choir
    * add/update/remove songs per chord
    * organize them by several categories (difficulty level, music type, amount of chords, etc.).
* manage my vocal exercises in a way that I could easily pick the most appropriate for a certain choir
    * add/update/remove vocal exercises per chord
    * organize them by several categories (difficulty level, diaphragm/mouth-related, etc.).
