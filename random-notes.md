## How do you identify a good solution (e.g. metrics)?
IMO, a good solution would be to have the app opened at least once per week (Engagement)
Most researches showed that signers practice the songs at least once per week.
Since this is a `training solution for signers`, that's the frequency I would expect.
Of course, this might change due to the song they're practicing, their skill level and other stuff.
But for that, I would suggest to measure them separately.
