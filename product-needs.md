In an attempt to start this project, I'll use this file to gather and organize all the ideas I have regarding the app.

### What people really want 
_(Extracted from https://medium.com/@jaf_designer/what-people-really-want-dc59821ccf9b)_

It's based on the Jobs to be Done concept (a blog that explains some of the concepts is [this one](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1952)).

* you don't want a scissor and a hair comb: you want your hair to look pretty.
* you don't want a toothbrush: you want to have a beatiful smile
Instead of focusing what people is saying, the idea is focusing on the job they want to avoid. And they want to avoid it because there is a problem related to that job. The job is the way of solving the problem, so you should focus on **satisfying needs by understanding the jobs people wan to get done**.

Some tips/phrases to remember:
* _products serve core needs, not what people want_ 
    * for example: I want to have all the chorus stuff in one place and use it to practice but is that what I really want to built? Why not aiming 4 smth bigger that could help others than me?
    * observe the users, don't ask them what they want. Find the UX strategies based on data and design for "core" needs.
* _help people to accomplish their goals, not to feel comfortable in an environment adapted to their characteristics_
    * understand the market. And for that, you need to know your market (which I don't!)
  * understand the "why" someone will ever use this product (what's bothering me?)
    * what about the five-why's technique? I could use it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
* _"triggers" make people to switch/fire/hire products_
    * they're based on at least three things:
        * present habits and how difficult can it be for them to change habits
        * problems with the current solutions that they'll like to got
        * concerns about the new solutions (like: is it legal? Is it ethical?)
        * how attracted are they to the new solution (Is it faster? Is it better?)
    * identifying the triggers will help me to differentiate from other products/solutions like the apps I found (<list apps found here!>).
