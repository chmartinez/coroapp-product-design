In an attempt to start this project, I'll use this file to gather and organize all the ideas I have regarding the app.


# JTBD
It's a framework to define products using the 'jobs' concept.

* What's a job? Check [this link](https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/) for more insights.
* What's important about Jobs? You need to understand the job, not the customer itself

## Some insights about its usage

#### What people really want 
_(Extracted from https://medium.com/@jaf_designer/what-people-really-want-dc59821ccf9b)_

* you don't want a scissor and a hair comb: you want your hair to look pretty.
* you don't want a toothbrush: you want to have a beatiful smile
Instead of focusing what people is saying, the idea is focusing on the job they want to avoid. And they want to avoid it because there is a problem related to that job. The job is the way of solving the problem, so you should focus on **satisfying needs by understanding the jobs people wan to get done**.

Some tips/phrases to remember:
* _products serve core needs, not what people want_ 
    * for example: I want to have all the chorus stuff in one place and use it to practice but is that what I really want to built? Why not aiming 4 smth bigger that could help others than me?
    * observe the users, don't ask them what they want. Find the UX strategies based on data and design for "core" needs.
* _help people to accomplish their goals, not to feel comfortable in an environment adapted to their characteristics_
    * understand the market. And for that, you need to know your market (which I don't!)
  * understand the "why" someone will ever use this product (what's bothering me?)
    * what about the five-why's technique? I could use it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
* _"triggers" make people to switch/fire/hire products_
    * they're based on at least three things:
        * present habits and how difficult can it be for them to change habits
        * problems with the current solutions that they'll like to got
        * concerns about the new solutions (like: is it legal? Is it ethical?)
        * how attracted are they to the new solution (Is it faster? Is it better?)
    * identifying the triggers will help me to differentiate from other products/solutions like the apps I found (<list apps found here!>).


## How to apply the JTBD framework?
* Switching question: _Is my product (or service) so good that my intended customer will stop using the product and make the switch?_
* What would you say you do here? (i.e: _What does your product or service actually do for the customer?_)
    * the answer could be even a list!
    * be both specific and general. Details matters
* _What social need does the product solve?_
* _What emotional need is being solved by the product?_
* _How will using the product make the customer feel?_
    * Based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)


## Jobs stories 

The concept is based on the JTBD framework. When you know what's the job your product is going to do for a person, then you can design your product focusing on:
* the triggering event
* the goal
* the intended outcome

The Job Story describes a struggling moment which the customer faces, how they visualize progress, and how life is better when they have a solution for that struggling moment.


### Basic Job Story format: 
```
When _____ , I want to _____ , so I can _____ .
```
For example: _When a new song is available, I want to be notified, so I can start listening to it._

Another way of putting it:
```
[ A moment of frustration ] + [ how progress is visualized ] + [ how life is better ]
```

There are some discrepancies about Job stories being a replacement for crappy user stories (check comments at https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27).
Maybe using the _Given-When-Then_ US's clauses could be enough...
